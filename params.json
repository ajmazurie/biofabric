{"name":"biofabric","tagline":"Python implementation of the BioFabric network visualization technique","body":"biofabric\r\n=========\r\n\r\n**biofabric** is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ library implementing the BioFabric network visualization technique described in Longabaugh 2012, *Combing the hairball with BioFabric: a new approach for visualization of large networks* and at http://www.biofabric.org/\r\n\r\nBioFabric is a new way to visualize networks in a simple, deterministic way, by laying out nodes and edges as rows and columns on a grid based on their degree. Such visualization allow for the quick identification of hubs, communities, and peculiar network topologies:\r\n\r\n.. figure:: http://github.com/ajmazurie/biofabric/raw/master/examples/demo_networkx_graphs/complete_graph-networkx.png\r\n\t:align: center\r\n\t:width: 700\r\n\t:alt: Complete graph (classical representation)\r\n\r\n\tComplete graph, using a classical representation\r\n\r\n.. figure:: http://github.com/ajmazurie/biofabric/raw/master/examples/demo_networkx_graphs/complete_graph-biofabric.png\r\n\t:align: center\r\n\t:width: 700\r\n\t:alt: Complete graph (BioFabric representation)\r\n\r\n\tSame graph, displayed using the BioFabric technique\r\n\r\nVarious examples of graphs displayed using BioFabric can be found at http://www.biofabric.org/gallery/index.html and in the ``examples/`` subdirectory.\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n**biofabric** is provided as an ``easy_install`` and ``pip`` compliant package which can be installed as follows:\r\n\r\n- to install the most up to date (and potentially unstable) version, type either ::\r\n\r\n\teasy_install https://github.com/ajmazurie/biofabric/archive/master.zip\r\n\tpip install https://github.com/ajmazurie/biofabric/archive/master.zip\r\n\r\n- to install a specific version, such as 0.1.0 (the latest stable version), type either ::\r\n\r\n\teasy_install https://github.com/ajmazurie/biofabric/archive/0.1.0.zip\r\n\tpip install https://github.com/ajmazurie/biofabric/archive/0.1.0.zip\r\n\r\n**biofabric** depends on two excellent libraries: `NetworkX <http://networkx.github.io/>`_ to manipulate networks, and `PyX <http://pyx.sourceforge.net/>`_ to produce an output in various formats (pdf, png, eps, jpg, etc.) following the BioFabric technique. ``easy_install`` will install these for you in case they are not already installed in your system.\r\n\r\nOnce **biofabric** installed, it can be used through the ``draw()`` function::\r\n\r\n\timport biofabric\r\n\r\n\t# generate a complete graph of 10 nodes using the\r\n\t# networkx library; this is the example shown above\r\n\timport networkx\r\n\tg = networkx.generators.classic.complete_graph(10)\r\n\r\n\t# draw it, as a PDF document\r\n\tbiofabric.draw(g, \"complete_graph.pdf\")\r\n\r\nDocumentation and additional examples can be found at https://github.com/ajmazurie/biofabric/wiki\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\n\r\n**biofabric** is released under a `MIT/X11 license <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
